# Leetcode Journey

This repo records all my solution and thoughts on problems on leetcode.

Codes are usually written in C++, while sometimes in C style.

Note: the first 13 problems are done before this repo exists. After then this repo will be update whenever a new problem is solved.
And starting from question 14, some thought will also be recorded in readme.md

## Basic structure

```
[Question Number]
├── code files       // Containing the solution.
└── readme.md        // A brief descreption of what I've done
```
